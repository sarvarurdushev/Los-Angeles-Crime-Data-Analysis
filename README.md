# Los Angeles Crime Data Analysis üöî

Los Angeles, California üòé. The City of Angels. Tinseltown. The Entertainment Capital of the World! 

Known for its warm weather, palm trees, sprawling coastline, and Hollywood, along with producing some of the most iconic films and songs. However, as with any highly populated city, it isn't always glamorous and there can be a large volume of crime. That's where this analysis comes in!

This project supports the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) by analyzing crime data to identify patterns in criminal behavior. The insights help allocate resources effectively to tackle various crimes in different areas.

## üîç Analysis Overview

This comprehensive crime analysis explores three critical questions for law enforcement resource allocation:

**1.** **Peak Crime Hours**: What time of day sees the highest crime frequency?  
**2.** **Night Crime Hotspots**: Which area has the most crimes during late-night hours (10pm-3:59am)?  
**3.** **Victim Demographics**: How are crimes distributed across different age groups?

## üîß Complete Analysis Code

```python
# Import required libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Read in and preview the dataset
crimes = pd.read_csv("crimes.csv", dtype={"TIME OCC": str})
crimes.head()

## Which hour has the highest frequency of crimes? Store as an integer variable called peak_crime_hour
# Extract the first two digits from "TIME OCC", representing the hour,
# and convert to integer data type
crimes["HOUR OCC"] = crimes["TIME OCC"].str[:2].astype(int)

# Preview the DataFrame to confirm the new column is correct
crimes.head()

# Produce a countplot to find the largest frequency of crimes by hour
sns.countplot(data=crimes, x="HOUR OCC")
plt.show()

# Midday has the largest volume of crime
peak_crime_hour = 12

## Which area has the largest frequency of night crimes (crimes committed between 10pm and 3:59am)? 
## Save as a string variable called peak_night_crime_location

# Filter for the night-time hours
# 0 = midnight; 3 = crimes between 3am and 3:59am, i.e., don't include 4
night_time = crimes[crimes["HOUR OCC"].isin([22,23,0,1,2,3])]

# Group by "AREA NAME" and count occurrences, filtering for the largest value and saving the "AREA NAME"
peak_night_crime_location = night_time.groupby("AREA NAME", 
                                               as_index=False)["HOUR OCC"].count().sort_values("HOUR OCC",
                                                                                               ascending=False).iloc[0]["AREA NAME"]

# Print the peak night crime location
print(f"The area with the largest volume of night crime is {peak_night_crime_location}")

## Identify the number of crimes committed against victims by age group (0-17, 18-25, 26-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, 65+) 
## Save as a pandas Series called victim_ages

# Create bins and labels for victim age ranges
age_bins = [0, 17, 25, 34, 44, 54, 64, np.inf]
age_labels = ["0-17", "18-25", "26-34", "35-44", "45-54", "55-64", "65+"]

# Add a new column using pd.cut() to bin values into discrete intervals
crimes["Age Bracket"] = pd.cut(crimes["Vict Age"],
                               bins=age_bins,
                               labels=age_labels)

# Find the category with the largest frequency
victim_ages = crimes["Age Bracket"].value_counts()
print(victim_ages)
```

## üìà Key Findings

### **Temporal Crime Patterns**
- **Peak Crime Hour**: **12 PM (Noon)** - Highest frequency of criminal incidents
- **Crime Distribution**: Clear hourly patterns visible in the analysis chart

### **Geographic Crime Hotspots**
- **Top Night Crime Area**: **Central** division experiences the highest volume of late-night crimes (10pm-3:59am)
- **Strategic Insight**: Night patrol resources should be prioritized in Central area

- **Age-Targeted Programs**: Develop crime prevention strategies for the 26-44 age demographic

### **Operational Insights**
- **Temporal Patterns**: Crime shows clear hourly variations requiring adaptive patrol scheduling
- **Geographic Concentration**: Night crimes cluster in specific areas, enabling targeted deployment
- **Demographic Trends**: Adult working-age populations face highest victimization rates

## üî¨ Research Applications

This analysis framework can be extended for:
